# ICF Trio

## What is the purpose of the ICF Trio Project?

The __ICF Trio__ project was developed for __IAR Embedded Workbench for Renesas RL78__ version __3.10 or later__. It uses a set of 3 files which together will lead to a proper linker configuration for the memory reservation requirements when there are __RL78 Flash Libraries__ in use.

## Benefits 
* Provides simplified setup for new projects relying on any of the __RL78 Flash Libraries__.
* Reduces the developer's efforts when linker reconfiguration is needed, specially when retargeting or switching to a different __RL78 Flash Library__.
* Offers contiguous __Code Flash__ which leads to improved flexibility for the compiled objects placement during the linking stage. This is achieved by taking advantage of the linker capability of placing all the `__near` constants from the __ending__ of the __Code Flash__'s mirrorable area.
* The improved object placement strategy might lead to substantial reduction of fragmentation of the __Code Flash__. This effect becomes more evident on RL78 targets with smaller __Code Flash__.

## Linker Configuration Trio Layout Specification

In this section you can understand how the __ICF Trio__ components fit together.

![ICF Trio layout](/images/icf_trio_layout.png)

| __File__                     | __Description__ |
| :--------------------------- | --------------- |
| __[trio_lnkR5F1`nn`X`n`.icf](trio_lnkR5F1---TEMPLATE.icf)__ | The first one is __user-selectable__. The selection is made based on the similarity in the memory map for distinct groups of RL78 targets. Each of these files hold the proper __Linker Configuration Override__ parameters which can be set on the __Project options__.<br><br>The `X` within the part number means that the linker configuration is offered regardless the target's pin count. For example, __trio_lnkR5F100xE.icf__ should be selected for a __R5F100LE__ target. |
| [common.icf](common.icf)     | The second is automatically included from the user-selected configuration. This is the heart of the Trio, containing parametrized directives which can be applied to any of the supported RL78 targets. |
| [self_ram.icf](self_ram.icf) | The third is automatically included by __common.icf__ to evaluate the same [symbol styles](README.md#rl78-flash-libraries-documentation-and-their-respective-required-linker-symbols-for-self-ram) used in the __IAR Embedded Workbench for RL78__ to handle every __Self-RAM__ reservation needs for the Trio. |


## Flash Library Flavors

The Renesas RL78 MCUs require specific set of library(/ies) to enable usage of their Flash Memories.

Renesas Electronics provides the __RL78 Flash Libraries__ in 3 different flavors:
- The **FSL** (Flash Self-Programming Library) does program the RL78's __Code Flash__. 
- The **FDL** (Flash Data Library) does program the RL78's __Data Flash__.
- The **EEL** (EEPROM Emulation Library) does emulate EEPROM behaviour on the RL78's __Data Flash__. It provides an extra layer of functionalities on top of its corresponding companion FDL Library Type (T01 or T02 - [explained below](README.md#flash-library-types)). It provides transparent [__Wear Leveling__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_leveling) among the provisioned __Data Flash__ blocks which may, in practice, virtually raise the amount of possible rewrites.


## Flash Library Types 

The __RL78 Flash Libraries__ flavors may be provided as one of the following library types:
- The **T01** (Type01, also known as **Full**) are the fully fledged Flash Libraries.
- The **T02** (Type02, also known as **Tiny**) are the balanced ones, providing the main functionalities at expense of less resources when compared with the T01 Libraries.
- The **T04** (Type04, also known as **Pico**) is the one providing only the bare essential functionalities. This library type offers the lowest resource usage footprint. Usually this is the suitable choice for the scenarios where the chosen RL78 target comes with constrained memory resources.

> __Note__ For further information regarding the complete feature set provided in each of these flash libraries, refer to their respective [documentation](README.md#rl78-flash-libraries-documentation-and-their-respective-required-linker-symbols-for-self-ram).


## Self-RAM 

Typically for every combination of RL78 MCU and __RL78 Flash Library__, the programmer would need to refer to the *Renesas Electronics*'  **[Application Note document r20ut2944](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/mah/rl78-family-self-ram-list-flash-self-programming-library)** in order to know if the chosen combination will require some specific RAM range to be reserved, therefore the chosen combination can function properly.

Self-RAM refers to the aforementioned RAM area, which __must__ be reserved on some cases, when relying on the RL78 MCU's self-programming capabilities.

In order to tremendously simplify this process, the __ICF Trio__ mostly automates it, by taking advantage of every advanced linker configuration directive available to override the default linker configuration, while following the requirements defined in the aforementioned Application Note. 


## How to use the ICF Trio

The following sections are going to serve as a straightforward step-by-step guide containing what is considered to be near the minimal actions that should be taken from scratch to configure a project to use the __ICF Trio__.

As reference, the RL78/G14 MCU (PN# __[R5F104LEAFA][url-r5f104leafa]__) will be used alongside the most popular __RL78 Flash Libraries__ combinations. Even then, the following steps should be similarly applicable to other RL78 targets.

## Required Software 

The following software components were successfuly usable alongside the __ICF Trio__:
- [IAR Embedded Workbench for RL78 version 4.20][url-ewrl78]
- [Git for Windows][url-git4win] 
- [Applilet3 for RL78][url-applilet3]
- A __RL78 Flash Library__ of your choice, downloadable from the Renesas Electronics Europe "MyPages". The download requires [pre-registration](https://www2.renesas.eu/products/micro/download/index.html/auth/register)or [sign-in](https://www2.renesas.eu/products/micro/download/index.html/auth/login) if you already are a registered user.

## Usage Guidelines 

### Install the tools  

**1.** Install the [IAR Embedded Workbench for RL78][url-ewrl78].

> __Note__ When installing the IAR Embedded Workbench for RL78, the installer also will offer the possibility to install a code generator tool named [AP4](https://www.renesas.com/products/software-tools/tools/code-generator/ap4-applilet.html). The AP4 is a GUI-based code generator that can generate peripheral drivers in C source containing driver functions for some of the RL78 targets.

**2.** For the purposes of this general guide, the selected target will be a general purpose RL78/G14 (PN# __[R5F104LEAFA][url-r5f104leafa]__). The target belongs to the *RL78/G14 Series*. The G14 Series uses a previous version of the AP4, the [Applilet3 for RL78][url-applilet3] configuration tool, which should then be installed.

**3.** Install [Git for Windows][url-git4win] on its defaults.

### Applilet3 base project creation

**4.** Start the __Applilet3__ tool, creating a new project which targets a __R5F104LEA__ (RL78/G14(ROM:64KB)) using the __IAR Compiler__ build tool, then choose a _Project Name_ and save it under the project's chosen _Place_. At this point, a new folder with the _Project Name_ is going to be created at the chosen _Place_.

![New Project](/images/3newproject.png)

**5.** On __Pin assignment__ tab, click on __Fix settings__.

![Pins Assignment](/images/pin_assignment.png)

**6.** On the __On-Chip debug setting__ tab, enable the __On-chip debug operation setting__.

![OCD](/images/5ocd.png)

**7.** Enable the __Low Voltage Detection__, selecting any coherent value for _VLVD_, such as *3.63V*. Save the Project. Finally, click on __Generate code__.

![CG LVD](/images/cg-lvd.png)

### IAR Embedded Workbench, project connection and setup

**8.** Start the __IAR Embedded Workbench for RL78__, save the the Workspace (`.eww`) on the same project folder which was created at the chosen _Place_. This folder can (and will) be referred by __IAR Embedded Workbench__ through its built-in environment variable `$PROJ_DIR$`.

> __Note__ The `$PROJ_DIR$` is an argument variable which can be conveniently used refer to relative pathnames when accessing the project's resources in the storage media. With __IAR Embedded Workbench__, you can use a wide range of built-in argument variables, as well as create your own. For more information search for __[Argument Variables][url-argvars]__ on the [__IAR Embedded Workbench IDE Project Management and Building Guide__][url-argvars].



**9.** Choose __Project__ â†’ __Create New Project...__ and create an empty RL78 project. Save it on the project's `$PROJ_DIR$` location.

**10.** Choose __Project__ â†’ __Add Project Connection...__ and point to the __.ipcf__ file which has been created by the __Applilet3__ when the code was generated.

![Workspace](/images/7workspace.png)

**11.** Invoke the context menu (right-click) on the __.ipcf__ file and choose _Open Containing Folder_. Invoke the context menu for the folder in the __Windows Explorer__ and choose __Git Bash Here__. This step will open a _Git Bash Shell_ at _Place_ (`$PROJ_DIR$`). From there perform:

 ```
 git clone https://github.com/iarsystems/ewrl78-linker-config-flashlibs.git
 ```

<details><summary><b>Expected output example</b> (click to unfold):</summary>
